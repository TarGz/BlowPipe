# Parametric BlowPipe 
> Works fine with Nerf dart



## USAGE

BlowPipe should be 1 meter long idealy, for the ease of printing the pipe is splitter in part.
Part should be printed verticallyly and each part should be as long as possible. That's why the main parameter of the script is the maximum print height of your printer.

You only have to specify the `printer_max_height` that correspond to your printer and then selected the `number_of_pipe`and then render the part in OpenScad. 


> Those part should be printed as they came out of the script without any support and a small infill around 10% is ok.
